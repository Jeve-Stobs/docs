# Profile Info

Do you want to know more about your(and others') profile? This tutorial is for you!

## All Profile Info

Run the `~profile` command to figure out all you need to know about your profile. If you wish to view another person's profile, run `~profile`, and ping the user you wish to view info about.

> ~profile `@User`

## Balance

Run the `~balance` command to check your balance. You can also view another user's wallet, by pinging the user in the `~balance` command.

> ~balance `@User`

## Bio

The Bio is a sort of description of yourself on your profile (it can really be anything you want). You can set your bio using `SetBio.` When people view your profile, they will see the bio you set up!

> ~setbio `Bio`

## Secret Balance

People cannot view your vault balance. All they will see are the number of digits that are in the vault, signified by dollar signs. If someone has 5 million, for example, their profile will show: "$$$$$$$". This is their secret balance.

### That is all that there is to know about your profile!
