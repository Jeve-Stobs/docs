# We can help!

## Acoustic can help you create a cool Discord server!

### Kickstart command

We have a lot of features. One of which is the reason you are here in the first place! Run the _Kickstart_ command, and Acoustic will automatically create everything you need for a fantastic server! If you enabled Community, Acoustic will create the fancy announcements and rules channel instead of normal text channels.

> ~kickstart all/information/roles/staff/channels
> Information = Announcements and Rules
> Roles = Staff/Server Booster roles
> Staff = Staff channels
> Channels = Text/Voice channels for the server members to talk

### Moderator commands

Moderator commands are just simple and quality-of-life features. They make life easy, and that is exactly what we want!
With our moderator commands, we can kick people, ban people, and give people roles!

> ~kick _user_ _reason_
> ~ban _user_ _reason_
> ~giverole _user_ _role_

## That's it! You now know how Acoustic can help your day-to-day server routine! If you want to do things yourself, we can still help.
