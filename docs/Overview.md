# Overview

## So... you want to make a professional Discord server, huh? We can walk you through that.

### Enable Community

Now, assuming you know how to use Discord and open the server settings, a good start to making a good server is enabling community. Fortunately, this is just a few clicks, and you're good. This will make it so members of your server can follow your announcements and see them on their server! You will also get a better rules system going.

### What we will cover

We are going to set up roles, staff stuff, channels, and categories. We're gonna get you started with some rules, announcements, staff, and server booster roles, staff channels, and important text/voice channels that belong in every server.

## Now that you know what we are going to set up, you are ready to move on to the next documents!
