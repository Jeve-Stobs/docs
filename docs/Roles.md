# Roles

## You want to set up roles for your community. Let's walk you through that, shall we?

### Giving people roles

In the member's section of the Discord server, on the right, right-click on a user. Hover over "Roles" and check or uncheck a role listed in the dropdown. If it is checked, then they have the role. If it is unchecked, then they don't.

### Permissions

In server settings, click on the roles section on the left. You will see a list. The higher the role is on the list, the higher priority it has. If members have multiple roles, the permissions combine. Hover over a role and click on the pencil icon. This will show you a list of all the permissions of the role. If it is green or checked, then the user has that permission. The most dangerous permission is Administrator. This will give people with the role EVERY permission making them essentially mini-owners.

## Well...now you know how to manage roles for your community.
